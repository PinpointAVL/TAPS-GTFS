# TAPS-GTFS
GTFS Feed for UCSC TAPS

**** DO NOT TRY TO EDIT THE XLSM FILE ON A MAC. IT WILL CORRUPT THE FEED ****

The main branch should contain the latest complete feed and nothing else.

All development should happen in the dev branch, where each feed version is fully contained in a directory named after the starting date of the service period the feed is for, in ISO 8601 format.
