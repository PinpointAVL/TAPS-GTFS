# TAPS-GTFS
GTFS Feed for UCSC TAPS

The main branch should contain the latest complete feed and nothing else.
All development should happen in the dev branch, where each feed version is fully contained in a directory named after the starting date of the service period the feed is for, in ISO 8601 format.
